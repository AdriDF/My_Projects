POInterest is a dashboard tool that uses data combined from Airbnb, the Overpass API & Google Maps (via Selenium and Beautiful Soup) to filter for and find an optimal selection of Airbnbs for travelers.

Our Tableau Dashboard:

* filters by both Airbnb and POI filters
* checks for fair prices via linear regression
* helps you understanding your neighbourhood better
* allows you to book an Airbnb directly in the interface
