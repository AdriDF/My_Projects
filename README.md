### Here you can find the Capstone Project I did with my team during my Data Analytics Bootcamp ###

My project was ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

POInterest is a dashboard tool that uses data combined from Airbnb, the Overpass API & Google Maps (via Selenium and Beautiful Soup) to filter for and find an optimal selection of Airbnbs for travelers.

Our Tableau Dashboard:

<p>filters by both Airbnb and POI filters
<p>checks for fair prices via linear regression
<p>helps you understanding your neighbourhood better
<p>allows you to book an Airbnb directly in the interface
